# 11.1 Warming Up

I chose Python as my language, as it is the language that I've been using throughout most of my studies.

As for linters, the most common tool we use at the University of Helsinki is [Pylint](https://pylint.org/), but there are also several other tools such as [Ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/#) and [Sonar](https://www.sonarsource.com/knowledge/languages/python/). From these three, Ruff seems to be gaining popularity for being a super fast linter, but being rather immature, it still lack many features included in Pylint, such as parameterization and invalid input checks, which is why devs still seem to prefer Pylint (for the most part). For test automation, by far the most popular library for unit testing is [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/), followed by the likes of [PyUnit](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyUnit). When it comes to E2E testing, depending on the needs, this is usually done with tools such as [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) or the Finnish classic, [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/). Python seems to somewhat lack in when it comes to build automation tools, but one popular choice is [PyBuilder](https://pybuilder.io/).

A few alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions are: [Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/), which is part of the AWS ecosystem. If you are using AWS, then the AWS CodePipeline might be a great choice for your project. GitLab is more secure than GitHub and has free community features, but is still comparably smaller platform.

Team of a six would still be considered to be fairly small, which makes me think that it would be easier to use a cloud service such as GitHub Actions. Considering the application is also in active development and almost release ready, setting up GitHub Actions in appropriate time would also be fairly easy when compared to self-hosting options. But it still depends on several other factors such as the complexity of the application and data intensity. Assuming the application is not very complex or data intensive, I would just fire up GHA.
